# Fraud-Detection-and-Prevention
Idea brief : 
Our idea leverages machine learning to enhance fraud detection and prevention in financial transactions. By integrating real-time data analytics, anomaly detection algorithms, and a continuously learning AI model, we aim to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities promptly. The system analyzes transaction patterns, user behaviors, and historical data to flag suspicious activities and provide actionable insights, ensuring enhanced security and reduced financial losses.

Tech Stack : 
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn


Positive and unique solutions : 
One innovative solution for hackathon fraud detection and prevention involves implementing a multi-layered verification system that combines technological and human elements. Firstly, participants could be required to undergo a thorough registration process that includes identity verification through government-issued IDs or biometric data. Secondly, during the hackathon itself, real-time monitoring of participants' activities could be conducted using AI-powered tools to detect suspicious patterns such as unusually high productivity or non-human interaction. Moreover, integrating blockchain technology for transparent and immutable record-keeping of submissions and team interactions could enhance trust and accountability. Finally, establishing a dedicated team of moderators and judges to oversee the event and promptly investigate any reported anomalies could provide an added layer of security. By combining these approaches, we can create a robust framework that mitigates fraud risks while promoting a fair and competitive hackathon environment.
